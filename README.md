Comparison between Serverless Framework and Terraform as tools for IaC

## Make a comparison between Serverless Framework and Terraform as tools for IaC by answering:

### What type of infrastructure and application deployments are each tool best suited for?
### Serverless framework:
- AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3
- Event-driven architectures
- Microservices and function-as-a-service (FaaS) deployments
- Applications that require rapid development and deployment cycles
### Terraform:
- Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud infrastructure.
- Complex, multi-tier architectures (e.g., VPCs, EC2 instances, RDS, Kubernetes clusters).
- Infrastructure that requires detailed provisioning and configuration.
- Long-term, stable infrastructure deployments.

### How do their primary objectives differ?

### How do they differ in terms of learning curve and ease of use for developers or DevOps teams?

### What are the differences in how each tool handles state tracking and deployment changes?

### In what scenarios would you recommend using Serverless Framework over Terraform, and vice versa?

### Are there scenarios where using both together might be beneficial?
