Comparison between Serverless Framework and Terraform as tools for IaC

## Make a comparison between Serverless Framework and Terraform as tools for IaC by answering:

### What type of infrastructure and application deployments are each tool best suited for?
- Serverless framework:
  - Type of infrastructure
    - AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3
    - Event-driven architectures
    - Microservices and function-as-a-service (FaaS) deployments
    - Applications that require rapid development and deployment cycles
  - Applications
    - Real-time data processing
    - Backend services
    - Applications with variable workloads
- Terraform:
  - Type of infrastructure
    - Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud infrastructure.
    - Complex, multi-tier architectures (e.g., VPCs, EC2 instances, RDS, Kubernetes clusters).
    - Infrastructure that requires detailed provisioning and configuration.
    - Long-term, stable infrastructure deployments.
  - Applications
    - Data centers, networking, and storage solutions
    - Applications requiring full control over infrastructure components

### How do their primary objectives differ?
- Serverless Framework
  - Primary Objective: Simplify the deployment and management of serverless applications
  - Focuses on abstracting away infrastructure complexity to allow developers to focus on writing code
  - Optimized for event-driven, serverless architectures.

- Terraform
  - Primary Objective: Provide a consistent and declarative way to manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers
  - Focuses on infrastructure provisioning and management, offering fine-grained control over resources
  - Designed for multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments
    
### How do they differ in terms of learning curve and ease of use for developers or DevOps teams?
- Serverless Framework
  - Learning Curve
    - Easier for developers familiar with serverless concepts
  - Ease of Use
    - Simple YAML-based configuration
    - Abstracts away much of the underlying infrastructure
    - Ideal for developers who want to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure
- Terraform
 - Learning Curve
    - Steeper due to its broader scope and complexity
  - Ease of Use
    - Requires understanding of HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
    - More suited for DevOps teams with infrastructure expertise
    - Provides detailed control, which can be overwhelming for beginners

### What are the differences in how each tool handles state tracking and deployment changes?
- Serverless Framework
  - State Tracking
    - Does not natively track state
    - Relies on the cloud provider's state management
  - Deployment changes
    -  Automatically handles updates to serverless resources
    -  Focuses on deploying application code and serverless configurations.
    -  Limited visibility into infrastructure changes
- Terraform
  - State Tracking
    -  Uses a state file (terraform.tfstate) to track the current state of infrastructure
  - Deployment changes
    -  Plans and applies changes incrementally, showing a detailed diff of what will be modified
    -  Provides full visibility into infrastructure changes
    -  Requires careful management of the state file (e.g., remote state storage)
  
### In what scenarios would you recommend using Serverless Framework over Terraform, and vice versa?

### Are there scenarios where using both together might be beneficial?
